Blog must:
- RSS feed!
- float title and date to support longer titles

Blog nice-to-haves:
- trackbacks??
- categories?
- category-specific feeds?
- pagination once many posts

Misc:
- reorganize site to use Jekyll entirely? e.g. "src/" and "bin/" folders?

Jekyll issues:
- Doesn't spit out .php, making auto mode a deal-breaker, preventing save-and-refresh development!
- YAML front matter is required for the templating system to kick in, which sort of sucks.
==> Should I just use regular PHP Markdown??
