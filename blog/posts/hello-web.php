        <p>It&#8217;s been <a href='http://aseemk.github.com/mit-website/' title='my old MIT website from 2008'>a few years</a> since I&#8217;ve had a website to call my own. That&#8217;s certainly ironic, given that I call myself a <a href='projects/'>web developer</a>.</p>

<p>Most of those few years for me were spent at <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Live_Labs'>Microsoft Live Labs</a>, home to some amazing people that built some equally <a href='http://gasi.ch/blog/live-labs/'>amazing technology</a>. At Live Labs, my thoughts and ideas were all public, whether through emails or frequent show-and-tells like those at the end of our <a href='http://windowseat.ca/item.php?id=342'>out-of-the-box weeks</a>. It was a very special community.</p>

<p>Now that Live Labs is no more, I&#8217;ve been longing to be a part of another such community, and what better one is there than the web at large? I&#8217;m especially inspired by <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a>; I was hooked the moment I made my first <a href='https://github.com/aseemk/seadragon-ajax/commit/f20c8c389862866f70ce17caf36da8cd79a3f4c0'>push</a>, my first <a href='https://github.com/aseemk/iscroll'>fork</a>, my first <a href='https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/pull/19'>pull request</a>.</p>

<p>So this is my <a href='about/'>introduction</a>. I&#8217;ll be sharing my thoughts and ideas here, and through them, I hope to make the web an even better place.</p>
<aside>Special thanks to <a href='http://gasi.ch/'>Daniel Gasienica</a> for encouraging me to create this blog. He mostly just wanted me to stop sending long emails, though. ;)</aside>
